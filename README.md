# Modeling_with-R
Scripts I created as a part of an online course I took that was using R to build predictive models in various areas

## The directories include these models:

#### Linear Regression
#### Logistic Regression
#### Classification and Regression Trees
#### Random Forests
#### Clustering
#### Text Mining
#### Visualisations
#### Combination of those to improve accuracy in Competition
